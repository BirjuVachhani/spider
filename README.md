# Spider

A small dart library to generate Assets dart code from assets folder.
It generates dart class with static const variables in it which can
be used to reference the assets safely anywhere in the flutter app.

### Example

#### Before
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'));
}
```

#### After
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage(Assets.background));
}
```

#### Generated Assets Class
```dart
class Assets {
  static const String background = 'assets/background.png';
}
```

This method allows no error scope for string typos. Also, it provides
auto-complete in the IDE which comes very handy when you have
large amount of assets.

## Installation

This is package is an independent library that is not linked to your
project. So there's no need to add it to your flutter project as it
works as a global command line tool for all of your projects.

```shell
pub global activate spider
```

Run following command to see help:

```shell
spider --help
```

## Usage

#### Create Configuration File
Spider provides a very easy and straight forward way to create
a configuration file.
Execute following command and it will create a configuration file
with default configurations in it.

```shell
spider create
```

Now you can modify available configurations and Spider will use
those configs when generating dart code.

#### Use JSON config file

Though above command creates `YAML` format for config file, spider
also supports `JSON` format for config file. Use this command to
create `JSON` config file instead of `YAML`.

```shell
spider create --json
```

No matter which config format you use, `JSON` or `YAML`, spider
automatically detects it and uses it for code generation.

Here's the default configuration that will be in the config file:

```yaml
groups:
  - path: assets/images
    class_name: Images
    package: res
```

### Generate Code

Run following command to generate dart code:

```shell
spider build
```

### Watch Directory
Spider can also watch given directory for changes in files and rebuild
dart code automatically. Use following command to watch for changes:

```shell
spider build --watch
```

see help for more information:
```shell
spider build --help
```

### Smart Watch (Experimental)

The normal `--watch` option watches for any kind of changes that happens
in the directory. However this can be improved my smartly watching the
directory. It includes ignoring events that doesn't affect anything like  
file content changes. Also, it only watches allowed file types and  
rebuilds upon changes for those files only.

Run following command to watch directories smartly.

```shell
spider build --smart-watch
```

### Categorizing by File Extension

By default, Spider allows any file to be referenced in the dart code.
but you can change that behavior. You can specify which files you want to be referenced.

```yaml
path: assets
class_name: Assets
package: res
types: [ jpg, png, jpeg, webp, bmp, gif ]
```

### Use Prefix
You can use prefixes for names of the generated dart references.
Prefixes will be attached to the formatted reference names.

```yaml
path: assets
class_name: Assets
package: res
prefix: ic
```

##### Output

```dart
class Assets {
  static const String icCamera = 'assets/camera.png';
  static const String icLocation = 'assets/location.png';
}
```

## Advanced Configuration
Spider provides supports for multiple configurations and classifications.
If you wanna group your assets by module, type or anything, you can do
that using `groups` in spider.

### Example
Suppose you have both vector(SVGs) and raster images in your project
and you want to me classified separately so that you can use them with
separate classes. You can use groups here. Keep your vector and raster
images in separate folder and specify them in the config file.

`spider.yaml`
```yaml
groups:
  - path: assets/images
    class_name: Images
    package: res
  - path: assets/vectors
    class_name: Svgs
    package: res
```

Here, first item in the list indicates to group assets of
`assets/images` folder under class named `Images` and the second
one indicates to group assets of `assets/vectors` directory under
class named `Svgs`.

So when you refer to `Images` class, auto-complete suggests raster
images only and you know that you can use them with `AssetImage` and
other one with vector rendering library.

## Multi-path configuration

From Spider `v0.4.0`, multiple paths can be specified for a single group  
to collect references from multiple directories and generate all the  
references under single dart class.

#### Example
```yaml
groups:
  - paths:
      - assets/images
      - assets/more_images/
    class_name: Images
    package: res
    types: [ .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .webm, .bmp ]
```

By using `paths`, multiple source directories can be specified. Above
example will generate references from `assets/images` and  
`assets/more_images/` under a single dart class named `Images`.

## Generating Tests

Spider `v0.4.0` adds support for generating test cases for generated  
dart references to make sure that the asset file is present in the  
project. These tests can also be run on CI servers. To enable tests
generation, specify `generate_tests` flag in `spider.yaml` or
`spider.json` configuration file as shown below.

```yaml
generate_tests: true
```
This flag will indicate spider to generate tests for all the generated  
dart references.

## Enable Verbose Logging

Spider prefers not to overwhelm terminal with verbose logs that are
redundant for most of the cases. However those verbose logs come quite
handy when it comes to debug anything. You can enable verbose logging by
using `--verbose` option on build command.

```shell
spider build --verbose

# watching directories with verbose logs
spider build --watch --verbose
```
