This package is an independent tool that is not linked to your project. So there's no need to add it to your flutter project as it works as a global command line tool for all of your projects.

This tool can be installed via pub. Execute following command to install it globally.

```shell
pub global activate spider
```

Run following command to see help:

```shell
spider --help
```

## Install via Homebrew

Spider has its own tap that can be used to install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```shell
brew tap birjuvachhani/spider
brew install spider
```
