# Spider

A small dart library to generate Assets dart code from assets folder. It generates dart class with static const variables in it which can be used to reference the assets safely anywhere in the flutter app.

[![Dart CI](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/workflows/Dart%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/actions) [![pub dev CD](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/workflows/Publish%20Package/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/actions) [![spider](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/spider?label=spider)](https://pub.dev/packages/spider)

## Breaking Changes since v1.0.0:

> Instead of declaring `package` name separately for each group, spider now takes `package` key-value pair as a global configuration.

### Example

#### Before
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'));
}
```

#### After
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage(Assets.background));
}
```

#### Generated Assets Class
```dart
class Assets {
  static const String background = 'assets/background.png';
}
```

This method allows no error scope for string typos. Also, it provides auto-complete in the IDE which comes very handy when you have large amount of assets.





### Watch Directory
Spider can also watch given directory for changes in files and rebuild dart code automatically. Use following command to watch for changes:

```shell
spider build --watch
```

see help for more information:
```shell
spider build --help
```

### Smart Watch (Experimental)

The normal `--watch` option watches for any kind of changes that happens in the directory. However this can be improved my smartly watching the directory. It includes ignoring events that doesn't affect anything like file content changes. Also, it only watches allowed file types and rebuilds upon changes for those files only.

Run following command to watch directories smartly.

```shell
spider build --smart-watch
```

### Categorizing by File Extension

By default, Spider allows any file to be referenced in the dart code. but you can change that behavior. You can specify which files you want to be referenced.

```yaml
path: assets
class_name: Assets
package: res
types: [ jpg, png, jpeg, webp, bmp, gif ]
```

### Use Prefix
You can use prefixes for names of the generated dart references. Prefixes will be attached to the formatted reference names.

```yaml
path: assets
class_name: Assets
package: res
prefix: ic
```

##### Output

```dart
class Assets {
  static const String icCamera = 'assets/camera.png';
  static const String icLocation = 'assets/location.png';
}
```

## Advanced Configuration
Spider provides supports for multiple configurations and classifications. If you wanna group your assets by module, type or anything, you can do that using `groups` in spider.

### Example
Suppose you have both vector(SVGs) and raster images in your project and you want to me classified separately so that you can use them with separate classes. You can use groups here. Keep your vector and raster images in separate folder and specify them in the config file.

`spider.yaml`
```yaml
groups:
  - path: assets/images
    class_name: Images
    package: res
  - path: assets/vectors
    class_name: Svgs
    package: res
```

Here, first item in the list indicates to group assets of `assets/images` folder under class named `Images` and the second one indicates to group assets of `assets/vectors` directory under class named `Svgs`.

So when you refer to `Images` class, auto-complete suggests raster images only and you know that you can use them with `AssetImage` and other one with vector rendering library.

## Multi-path configuration

From Spider `v0.4.0`, multiple paths can be specified for a single group to collect references from multiple directories and generate all the references under single dart class.

#### Example
```yaml
groups:
  - paths:
      - assets/images
      - assets/more_images/
    class_name: Images
    package: res
    types: [ .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .webm, .bmp ]
```

By using `paths`, multiple source directories can be specified. Above example will generate references from `assets/images` and `assets/more_images/` under a single dart class named `Images`.

## Generating Tests

Spider `v0.4.0` adds support for generating test cases for generated dart references to make sure that the asset file is present in the project. These tests can also be run on CI servers. To enable tests generation, specify `generate_tests` flag in `spider.yaml` or `spider.json` configuration file as shown below.

```yaml
generate_tests: true
```
This flag will indicate spider to generate tests for all the generated dart references.

## Enable Verbose Logging

Spider prefers not to overwhelm terminal with verbose logs that are redundant for most of the cases. However those verbose logs come quite handy when it comes to debug anything. You can enable verbose logging by using `--verbose` option on build command.

```shell
spider build --verbose

# watching directories with verbose logs
spider build --watch --verbose
```
