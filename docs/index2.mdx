# Spider

A small dart **command-line tool** to generate Assets dart code from assets folder. It generates dart class with **static const** variables in it which can be used to reference the assets **safely** anywhere in the flutter app.

[![Build](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/spider/actions) [![spider](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/spider?label=spider)](https://pub.dev/packages/spider)

## Breaking Changes since v4.0.0:

- `--info` flag command is now `--about` command.
- `--check-updates` flag command is now `--check-for-updates`.

## What it does?

Spider generates references for the local assets used in your project by creating dart referece classes which are safe
and easy to use anywhere.

**Example**

Before

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'));
}
```

After

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage(Assets.background));
}
```

Generated Assets Class

```dart
class Assets {
  static const String background = 'assets/background.png';
}
```

## Why Spider?

- Lightening fast code generation.
- Safe access to assets. No more typos!
- IDE auto-complete support.
- No dependecy on the project.
- Easy to configure.
- Way more customizable.
- Supports tests generation.
- Less VCS noise.
- Import friendly (exportable as library).
- Well documented.
