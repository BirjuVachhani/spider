## Generating Tests

> This feature is introduced in Spider [v0.4.0](/spider/changelog/#040)

Spider supports for generating test cases for generated dart references to make sure that the asset file is present in the project. These tests can also be run on CI servers. To enable tests generation, specify `generate_tests` flag in `spider.yaml` or `spider.json` configuration file as shown below.

```yaml
generate_tests: true
```
This flag will indicate spider to generate tests for all the generated dart references.

## Enable Verbose Logging

Spider prefers not to overwhelm terminal with verbose logs that are redundant for most of the cases. However those verbose logs come quite handy when it comes to debug anything. You can enable verbose logging by using `--verbose` option on build command.

```shell
spider build --verbose

# watching directories with verbose logs
spider build --watch --verbose
```
