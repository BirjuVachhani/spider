> This feature is introduced in Spider [v4.1.0](/spider/changelog/#410)

If the package you're using is bundling its package assets (You can read more about it on offical Flutter
docs [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/assets-and-images#bundling-of-package-assets).) and has exposed generated dart
references for bundled package assets, then you can use them in your application too.

#### IMPORTANT:
> It is a hard requirement from Flutter that you must specify each and every asset path individually in the assets section of your application's `pubspec.yaml`.
> Otherwise AssetBundle won't be able to find the package assets. So specifying `packages/<package_name>/images/` doesn't work.

This is how you have to specify assets in your application's `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - packages/<package_name>/images/image1.png
    - packages/<package_name>/images/image2.png
    - packages/<package_name>/images/image3.png
    - packages/<package_name>/images/image4.png
    - packages/<package_name>/images/image5.png
```

Once you have this configuration in your application, You can use those package references just like how you use your own asset references.

for example,

```dart
Image.asset(PackageImages.image1);
```

Keep in mind that, for this to work, the package itself has to include dart references for the assets put inside `lib` of the package.
