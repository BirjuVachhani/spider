#### Default Configuration
Spider provides a very easy and straight forward way to create a configuration file. Execute following command and it will create a configuration file with default configurations in it.

```shell
spider create
```

Now you can modify available configurations and Spider will use those configs when generating dart code.

#### Use JSON config file

Though above command creates `YAML` format for config file, spider also supports `JSON` format for config file. Use this command to create `JSON` config file instead of `YAML`.

```shell
spider create --json
```

No matter which config format you use, `JSON` or `YAML`, spider automatically detects it and uses it for code generation.

Here's the default configuration that will be in the config file:

```yaml
# Generated by Spider

# Generates unit tests to verify that the assets exists in assets directory
generate_tests: true

# Use this to remove vcs noise created by the `generated` comments in dart code
no_comments: true

# Exports all the generated file as the one library
export: true

# This allows you to import all the generated references with 1 single import!
use_part_of: true

# Location where all the generated references will be stored
package: resources

groups:
  - path: assets/images
    class_name: Images
    types: [ .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .webm, .bmp ]
```

Now that the configuration file is created, it's time to [generate some code](generate.md).
