### Auto Build
Spider can also watch given directory for changes in files and rebuild dart code automatically. Use following command to watch for changes:

```shell
spider build --watch
```

see help for more information:
```shell
spider build --help
```

### Smart Watch (Experimental)

The normal `--watch` option watches for any kind of changes that happens in the directory. However this can be improved my smartly watching the directory. It includes ignoring events that doesn't affect anything like file content changes. Also, it only watches allowed file types and rebuilds upon changes for those files only.

Run following command to watch directories smartly.

```shell
spider build --smart-watch
```
