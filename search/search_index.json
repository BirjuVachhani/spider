Safe access to assets. No more typos! IDE auto-complete support. No dependecy on the project. Easy to configure. Way more customizable. Supports tests generation. Less VCS noise.

If you wanna group your assets by module, type or anything, you can do that using groups in spider. Example Suppose you have both vector(SVGs) and raster images in your project and you want to me classified separately so that you can use them with separate classes. You can use groups here. Keep your vector and raster images in separate folder and specify them in the config file. spider.yaml groups : - path : assets/images class_name : Images package : res - path : assets/vectors class_name : Svgs package : res Here, first item in the list indicates to group assets of assets/images folder under class named Images and the second one indicates to group assets of assets/vectors directory under class named Svgs . So when you refer to Images class, auto-complete suggests raster images only and you know that you can use them with AssetImage and other one with vector rendering library. Categorizing by File Extension \u00b6 By default, Spider allows any file to be referenced in the dart code. but you can change that behavior. You can specify which files you want to be referenced. path : assets class_name : Assets package : res types : [ jpg , png , jpeg , webp , bmp , gif ] Sub grouping \u00b6 Starting from v3.2.0 , you can specify sub groups for a group if you ever want to use different prefixes for different types. groups : - class_name : Images sub_groups : - path : assets/images prefix : png types : [ .png ] - path : assets/vectors prefix : svg types : [ .svg ] This configuration will add png prefix for the generated references if it is a PNG image file and jpg prefix if it is a JPG or JPEG image file.
