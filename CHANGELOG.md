## 1.0.0

- Added support for exporting generated dart code which is enabled by
default This can be helpful in cases where you want to use a single file
to import all of the generated classes. (Accessible individual classes
when importing)

- Added support to use opt in for usage of `part of` feature of dart. It
allows to avoid false imports when using export option. It makes all the
generated dart code files to behave like one file and one import.
- Added support to remove `Generated by spider...` comment line from all
the generated dart code. Allows to minimize vcs noise.
- `export_file` can be used to provide name of the export file.

#### Breaking Changes

- Instead of providing `package` to every group, now you have to define
global `package` name as it makes more sense. Providing package name for
individual groups won't work.
