## 1.0.0

- Added support for exporting generated dart code which is enabled by
  default This can be helpful in cases where you want to use a single file
  to import all of the generated classes. (Accessible individual classes
  when importing)

- Added support to use opt in for usage of `part of` feature of dart. It
  allows to avoid false imports when using export option. It makes all the
  generated dart code files to behave like one file and one import.

  the generated dart code. Allows to minimize vcs noise.
- `export_file` can be used to provide name of the export file.

  individual groups won't work.
